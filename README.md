# AppSamples
This are personal experimentations on trying to code some ideas that 
randomly comes in mind. The aim is to create useful small application 
while reinforcing fundamentals learned by forcing myself to use them 
over and over again in different contexts to solve problems.




## Links checker
This algorithm checks the entire webpage of a website then report to you 
whether or not every links on the page are active. The problem I was 
trying to solve here is having a way to save time while doing maintenance 
or proofing an html page before officially publishing a site.

> **How to use it**:\
> Replace the sitmap string with a real website and remember 
to add the quotation marks when you're done as the address need 
to be a string

## Roman numbers convertor
The problem I was trying to solve here was a series of poster 
designs that needed to have 31 big odds numbers written as Roman 
numerals for a community campaign. Since the project had multiple 
updates and the numbers were long and odd ones, I needed to have 
an easy way to quickly convert them in roman without having 
to think about it let alone rechecking each time when Iâ€™m done, 
if whether or not I correctly wrote it.

> **How to use it**:\
> Run it first then type in any number you want converted in roman
and press return (or "Enter" on a windows keyboard).
